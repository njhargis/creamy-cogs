# Overview
The pluginss in this repo are exclusively for Red Bot. Please read over the installation instructions and documentation for more information on how to use these cogs.

# Installation
First make sure you have [Red Bot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop) installed.

Next add my repo using the following command:  

`[p]repo add creamycogs https://github.com/njhargis/creamy-cogs V3`    

> [p] will be your prefix.

Then, you will have to download each cog individually. For example, if you want to download the League of Legends cog, you would enter the following command:

`>cog install creamycogs leaguecog`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update the cogs. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by typing `[p]cog update leaguecog`.
